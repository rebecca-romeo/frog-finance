# Budgets

Users can update their monthly budget  if a particular category needs more or less money allocated to it. Also, each time an expense is made, the progress bar and amounts spent are automatically adjusted for that month's budget.

# View according to month
Users can view income, expenses, and budgets according to any month they choose

# Savings
Users can create one savings goal at a time. For example, here we are saving $14,000 for education. The amount saved is automatically calculated based on the user's income, expenses, and debt payments.

When a goal is reached, it's removed from the Savings Goal page and added to the Savings Achievement page

# Debt
Users can create a debt goal, and update the amount owing.

For example, we owe $1000 on our Credit Card at a 15% interest rate. Once the goal is created, we can update it each time a payment is made.

When a debt has been paid off, it is removed from the Debt Goal page and added to the Debt Achievements page where the user can view all the debts they've paid off

# Stocks
Users can learn about stocks by searching for a ticker and viewing the market trends. They can see how prices change over the course of a day, week, month, and year. Here, we are using Apple (aapl) as an example.
